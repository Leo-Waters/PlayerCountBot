# PlayerCountBot
 A player count discord bot docker, used to show a games player count via a text channel

 I have been running this bot on a raspberry pi but since upgrading, I decided to go down the docker route, the docker file was written by chat gpt, due to time constraints and current limited docker knowledege.
